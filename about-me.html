        <section>
            <p>Hello! <br> My name is Zahra. I'm 18 years old . I was in Class 10 when schools in Afghanistan were closed and unfortunately I couldn't continue my
            education, but with all the problems and obstacles and restrictions that exist in my country for girls, I still didn't
            disappoint and I was able to finish English and now I teach English . </p>

            <p>I'm very interested in English and I'm currently working to get a TOEFL degree. I'm also busy teaching English and I
            really enjoy being able to help more students. In addition, I worked on several projects as a translator, which
            strengthened my language and communication skills. On the other hand, my curiosity about AI and computers got me into
            the world of programming. I started learning with YouTube and soon realized that I was very interested in it, and that's
            what motivated me to continue and learn more deeply. Athletically, I'm very interested in boxing, and I've been
            practicing it for a few months, with the goal of being able to compete professionally one day. I've also been working in
            Parkour for over a year, which is both challenging and exciting for me. My main goals are to be able to learn
            programming professionally and work with big tech companies, and to get my TOEFL degree to expand my English teaching
            path.</p>
